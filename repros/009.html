			When you open this in Safari on the Desktop (I used 26.1), and start a
			composition in the empty contenteditable field.<br /><br />
			E.g. use the dead key <code>^</code> and then press
			<code>a</code>).<br /><br />
			Notice how the original editable-field div gets destroyed (the blue dashed
			border disappears).<br /><br />
			Now, comment out the position: relative rule, and try again. Now it works
			as expected. Placing a position: relative rule changes the behavior of
			contenteditable. 😱😱😱<br /><br />
			In Chrome/Firefox, this problem does not occur.<br /><br />
